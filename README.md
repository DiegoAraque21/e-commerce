# E-commerce

A simple shop site, where you can add products to your cart and order them. Also you can add the products you want to sell, and they would be able to everyone.

Some technologies that i used:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDb
- EJS
- Stripe (for payments). Really basic implementation
- Bootstrap

The app was deployed in heroku, you can visit the site here: http://e-commerce-diego-project.herokuapp.com/

Note: In the project, server-side rendering is used instead of performing a REST API.
